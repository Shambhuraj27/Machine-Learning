# Machine Learning Case Studies 

This repository contains a collection of machine learning case studies, covering classification, regression, and predictive modeling techniques. Each case study demonstrates how to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate performance using different ML algorithms.

## Case Studies Included

1. **Fraud Detection Case Study**  
   - Detects fraudulent transactions using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.
